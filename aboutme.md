<div class="about-me">

My name is **Shirin Shoushtari**, and I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the **Department of Electrical and Systems Engineering (ESE)** at **Washington University in St. Louis**. I am a member of the [Computational Imaging Group (CIG Lab)](https://cigroup.wustl.edu), advised by [Professor Ulugbek Kamilov](https://cigroup.wustl.edu/ulugbek-s-kamilov/).  

My research focuses on **computational imaging**, **medical image analysis**, **inverse problems**, and **distribution shift** in learning-based reconstruction methods. I am particularly interested in developing algorithms that enhance the robustness and interpretability of imaging systems.  

Before joining Washington University, I earned my **B.Sc.** and **M.S.** degrees in **Electrical Engineering (Communication Systems)** from **Sharif University of Technology**, Tehran, Iran, in 2017 and 2020, respectively. I began my Ph.D. studies at Washington University in **January 2022**.
